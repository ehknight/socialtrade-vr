                                    This product is based on the successful SocialTrade.com web site which was created 
                                    for stock, options, and futures traders. Over the years, tens of thousands of charts
                                    and graphics have been shared and are available to you know in the virtual world.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This site has been designed principally for the HTC Vive, since that currently offers
                                    the most compelling experience. However, you can also navigate the site on your 
                                    computer's browser, with an Android phone, or an iPhone (using the Chrome app). 
                                    Specific platform notes are at the bottom of this window.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                   Navigating within SocialTrade is simple. You will first be presented with six general categories of 
                                    content (Analytics, Business, Government, Other, Patterns, Trading Instruments). Click on any of those, and 
                                    the sub-categories will be loaded (remember to look above the first "level" of boxes, since there may be more 
                                    stacked above). The most important thing to know about navigation is that you <em>click 
                                    on the white buttons below each image, not the image itself</em>. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    After you have drilled down from the category you want, and then the sub-category, you will be presented 
                                    with as many as fifty individual charts. Look up and see how tall the images go. You can click on any of
                                    the description boxes to "zoom up" to that level. Once you are at the very top, you may see a large green
                                    arrow which allows you to load the next set of fifty charts. Please note that these are in reverse chronological 
                                    order, which means you see the most recent items first and can progress backwards in time as many 
                                    years as you like.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The last navigation tip to keep in mind is how to go backward. At all times there is a "floor" beneath you. 
                                    You can click on this floor to be transported back to the ground level. This is particularly useful 
                                    when you are floating very high up. Also, in the center of the floor is a sphere that has the word 
                                    "Back" printed on it. Clicking this sends you back: for example, to the next level higher in in the hierarchy, 
                                    or to the prior 50 charts that were displayed.
                                </p>
